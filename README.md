This small Python program calculates the distance between 2 points in a defined amount of dimensions, the amount of dimensions can be infintely high.
Important: Only input Integers! If you get an error, you probably didn't input an integer.
Everything else should be self explanatory, just input every value and it automatically calculates the distance.
There might be coming a program with infinite possible points, which calculates their distance to a specified point.
